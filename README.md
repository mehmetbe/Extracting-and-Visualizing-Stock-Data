# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

In this project, Tesla and Gamestop's stock and revenue data are visualized in Plotly. Stock data of both companies were downloaded using yFinance module and the companies ticker symbols. The revenue data of both companies were webscraped from www.macrotrends.net, using requests and beautifulsoup objects. Finally, a function was defined that plots the stock and revenue data with a slider that enables zooming in to a certain time period, with time being shown as hovered over the plot. Please refer to the screenshots below for Tesla's historical stock and revenue datas with date slider switched up.
